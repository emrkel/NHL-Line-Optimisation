# NHL-Line-Optimisation

This project aims to optimise NHL line combinations and defensive pairings using statistical analysis and optimisation techniques. The goal is to create the most effective line combinations for a given NHL team based on player performance. 

## Introduction 

Ice Hockey is a unique team sport which relies on line combinations to maximise performance on the ice. A well constructed forward line or defensive pairing can enhance chemistry, exploit player strengths and improve overall team efficiency and output. The objective of this project is to develop a NHL line optimisation tool that suggests the most optimal line combinations and defensive pairings for any given team. 

## Project Overview 

The project utilises historical player performance data and statistical analysis to evaluate player effectiveness in various contexts. It considers a range of factors such as player stats, playing styles, positions and past experience to determine the most efficient line combinations. 

The optimisation process involves finding the best combinations that maximise team performance based on predefined objectives. This may include goals scored, points earned, possession metrics and other performance indicators. The project aims to balance individual performance and team chemistry to create well-balanced and productive lines. 

## Project Steps 

1. Data Collection - https://www.moneypuck.com/data.htm
2. Data Preprocessing - Clean and normalise the data 
3. Determine Objective Function 
4. Define the constraints 
5. Create the Optimisation Algorithm and implement 
6. Test to see how optimal lines correlate to past NHL lines
